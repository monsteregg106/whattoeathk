## Technical Details

### **How It Works**
1. Admin panel saves changes to browser storage
2. Your app automatically loads the changes when opened
3. If no changes exist, it uses default content

### **File Structure**
```
simple-admin/
├── admin.html          # Admin interface
├── config.json         # Default configuration  
├── config-loader.js    # Connects admin to your app
└── README.md          # This guide
```

### **Backup Your Changes**
Your changes are saved in the browser's local storage. To backup:
1. Open admin panel
2. Make your changes
3. Copy the content to save externally if needed

## Troubleshooting

### **Problem: Changes don't appear**
- **Solution**: Make sure you clicked "Save All Changes"
- **Solution**: Refresh your main app page

### **Problem: Images won't upload**
- **Solution**: Check file size (must be under 2MB)
- **Solution**: Use JPG, PNG, or GIF format only

### **Problem: Admin panel won't open**
- **Solution**: Make sure you're opening `admin.html` in a web browser
- **Solution**: Check that all files are in the same folder

### **Problem: Text is cut off**
- **Solution**: Check the character counter - you might be over the limit
- **Solution**: Shorten your text to fit the recommended length

## Tips for Best Results

### **Writing Good Content**
- **Keep titles short** - they look better and load faster
- **Use action words** for buttons - "SPIN NOW" vs "Click Here"  
- **Be descriptive** but brief for wheel segments
- **Test on mobile** - longer text might not fit on small screens

### **Choosing Good Images**
- **Use high quality** images that aren't blurry
- **Transparent backgrounds** work best for characters
- **Bright, cheerful** images match the app's fun theme
- **Test different sizes** to see what looks best

### **Color Selection**
- **High contrast** colors are easier to read
- **Bright colors** make the wheel more exciting
- **Avoid similar colors** next to each other on the wheel
- **Consider accessibility** - some users may be colorblind
